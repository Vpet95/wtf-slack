# Glossary of Terms
# TODO: add command for examples, and break out the multi-line definitions into "definitions" and "examples" sections
SEED_DATA = {
    "AE": "'account executive' - this role maintains ongoing relationships with customers",
    "MBO": """'Management Based Objective' - abstract targets / objectives that are not necessarily tracked in a concrete way, but are important for the company nonetheless.
     Examples include:`**welcome@quotapath.com**
        - Become a market leader
        - Become a member of the fortune 500
        - Raise brand profile by 25%
        - Increase win ratio by 10%""",
    "SDR": """'Sales Development Representative' - responsible for outbound sales prospecting.
        Rather than trying to close deals, their work revolves around generating and qualifying new leads - and moving them through the sales pipeline.""",
    "ARR": """'Annual Recurring Revenue':
        - The total dollar value of revenue from all customers in a year.
        - Multi-year contracts only contribute their year's worth to this number (e.g. a $10m 2-year contract contributes $5m to the ARR)""",

# **MRR - Monthly Recurring Revenue**

# - Same as ARR, but tracked/measured monthly

# **GRR - Gross Retention Rate**

# - Percentage of renewed dollars over a defined period of time. Calculated by `Renewed dollars / Renewable dollars`, for example: if a $5m contract is renewed for $4m, your GRR is 80%
# - **This does not include cross-sell or upsell, so max is capped at 100%**

# **NRR - Ret Retention Rate**

# - Basically GRR, but cross-sell and upsell counts, so max can be >100%
# - Calculated as `(Renewed dollars + Expansion dollars) / Renewable dollars`
# - Example: you renewed a $5m contract for $4m, but also sold $2m in upsell and cross sell, so your NRR is 120%

# It's beyond the scope of this glossary to explain whether to optimize for GRR or NRR, but know that it's a topic. You can google for "GRR vs NRR" to find some discussion on it. In general, GRR presents a "bottom line" you shouldn't cross (below 60% if you sell to small businesses, below 70% if you sell to large enterprises).

# **CLTV - Customer Lifetime Value**

# - Considered the "holy grail" of financial metrics
# - Not typically looked at or analyzed directly, but ideally wants to be maximized
# - Calculation: `Average Transaction Value * Average Retention Time * Number of Transactions`
# - Example: customer spends an average of $100 per renewal every month for four years (48 months) has a CLTV of $4800

# **CAC - Customer Acquisition Cost**

# - Calculated as: `Sales & Marketing expenditure / Number of new customers`
# - Example: you spend $1m a year on sales & marketing staffing, programs, and ops, and you book 100 new companies during that year, your CAC is $10,000

# **CRC - Cost of Retaining a Customer**

# - Same as CAC, except you need to calculate the sum of all of your retention-related operations, programs, and staff. This can include customer success managers, technology, account managers, onboarding, and more
# - Calculated as: `Retention costs / Number of retained customers`

# In general, the cost of retaining a customer tends to be much lower than the cost of acquiring a new customer. In recurring revenue models, it tends to be just as, if not, more important to retain customers (Lean Revenue) as it is to find new ones (Expensive Revenue). **Lean Revenue -** Revenue from existing clients; tends to be where most of the profit comes from, and can include Deferred Revenue Recognition, Unbilled Deferred Revenue Recognition, Renewal of Existing Customer Agreements, Expansions of those Agreements. **Expensive Revenue -** Revenue from new clients. Initially unprofitable due to CAC. Can be broken into two types:

# - **Good** - worth the long term investment
# - **Bad** - never becomes profitable

# **COGS -** Cost of Goods Sold

# **MQL - Marketing Qualified Lead** - a lead who has indicated interest in what a brand has to offer based on marketing efforts or is otherwise more likely to become a customer than other leads.

# **ICP - Ideal Customer Profile** - a type of company that would gain the most value from your product or solution. To assess whether a company is an ICP, you might look at:

# - The average size of the company
# - Its average revenue
# - Its industry
# - Its location

# **Buyer Persona** - descriptions of the type of people at ICP companies who needs to be involved in the purchasing decision

# **King Customer -** A customer that takes too many resources from the business

# **NPS - Net Promoter Score** - a metric that measures the loyalty of customers to a company. Typically measured with a response to a single survey question, the infamous "How likely are you to recommend XYZ to a friend or colleague?". Usually on a scale of 1-10. People fall into the following categories:

# - **Promoters** - respond with 9-10
# - **Passives** - respond with 7-8
# - **Detractors** - responds with 0-6

# **OTE - On Target Earnings** - the amount of money you can expect to earn if you hit 100% of your quota; usually given as an annual figure

# - Calculated as: `Annual base salary + annual commission earned at 100% of quota`
# - Not guaranteed - you'll want to look at average attainment

# **EBR -** Executive Business Review

# **CSM -** Customer Success Manager

# **ROI -** Return on Investment

# **Recurring revenue**: Money a company can reliably predict it will earn from regular, stable transactions in the future. Three common forms:

# - Subscriptions
# - Long-term Contracts
# - Supplementary Purchases (think: k-cups, printer ink, razor blades)
